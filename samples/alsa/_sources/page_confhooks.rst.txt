Hooks in configuration files
============================

The hook extension in the ALSA library allows expansion of configuration nodes at run-time. The existence of a hook is determined by the presence of a @hooks compound node.

This example defines a hook which loads two configuration files at the beginning:

.. ref-code-block:: cpp

    @hooks [
        {
            func load
            files [
                "/etc/asound.conf"
                "~/.asoundrc"
            ]
            errors false
        }
    ]

.. rubric:: Function reference:

* The function load - ``snd_config_hook_load()`` - loads and parses the given configuration files.

* The function load_for_all_cards - ``snd_config_hook_load_for_all_cards()`` - loads and parses the given configuration files for each installed sound card. The driver name (the type of the sound card) is passed in the private configuration node.
